### Hiya!

I'm simplesentai, and welcome to my GitHub! Here's where my website code lives, as well as the other millions (at least, that's what it feels like) of repos.

I'm currently a high school student, hoping to be a computer science major :)

I mainly use Python and the web languages (CSS, HTML, JS). However, I am currently attempting to branch out to Java / CPP.

See ya in the _Repositories_ tab!

With much love,
simplesentai
